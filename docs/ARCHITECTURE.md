# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The steganography service is built using a modular Django architecture with the following key components:

```
steganography_service/
├── Core Application
│   ├── File Processing
│   ├── Steganography Engine
│   └── Storage Management
├── User Management
│   ├── Authentication
│   └── Profile Management
└── API Layer
    ├── REST Endpoints
    └── Security
```

## Key Components

### 1. Steganography Engine
- Implements LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm
- Supports multiple file formats
- Handles message embedding and extraction

### 2. File Processing
- Secure file upload handling
- Background processing using Celery
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms

### 3. Security Layer
- JWT authentication
- File validation
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection

### 4. Storage Management
- Separate upload/processed directories
- Automatic file cleanup
- Storage quota management

## Data Flow

1. User uploads file → Validation → Storage
2. Processing request → Queue → Steganography
3. Result → Storage → User notification

## Performance Considerations

- Background processing for large files
- Caching for frequent requests
- Database query optimization
- File cleanup scheduling

## Security Measures

- Input validation
- File type verification
- Size limitations
- Secure file storage
- Authentication requirements
