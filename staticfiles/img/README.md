# Image Assets Directory

This directory contains all static image assets used in the project.

## Directory Structure
- `favicon/` - Favicon files in various sizes
- `icons/` - UI icons and symbols
- `logos/` - Project logos and branding
- `placeholders/` - Placeholder images for development

## Usage Guidelines
1. Use SVG format for icons and logos when possible
2. Optimize all images before committing
3. Follow naming convention: `purpose_name_size.extension`
4. Keep original files in a separate source directory
